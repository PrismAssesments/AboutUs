* Why you choose the language you did
It looks like a 100% font end task and assuming JS will be the best fit for this type of tasks: manipulating with weblements.
However there are libraries that allow to accomplish those types of tasks easy by using other programming languages. Final selection of Java was determined by knowledge compare to other languages.


* what the primary design decisions were in implementing your solution and why you made the choices you did
 -a) to GET webpage
 -b) to parse webpage
 -c) to store resulting data in the hashmap data structure as the most appropriate for that type of data.
 
* If you ran out of time, what you were hoping to do next
 -a) Probably it makes sense to make hashmap generic.
